     <h2>PROFILE</h2>
        <nav>
         <p>To begin, I'd like to express my motivation and drive to accomplish this bootcamp with the guidance of excellent
         instructors like the three I've thus far been introdced to. Kyle, Rob, and James(in order of meeting). To succeed 
         through a school that I have respect and awe toward will develop a devotion and dedication that will last throughout
         my potential career with the ability to code and program.
         An extensive goal to understand and complement IT, as well as cybersec systems, this seems to be a natural occurance
         to begin with for my personal learning ability and preference. I've striven toward the development of a technical
         career and hobby for some time now, and the direction that I have received just with the conversations that I have
         experienced with GCU staff has been very agreeable with my personality. I have decidedly chosen the path of this
         bootcamp due to the etiquette and patience of my counselors(Marsha Burton and Kyle Richardson), along with the
         'push' I've recevied from proper critique offered by my interview experience with James, I did not find place for
         other consideration.
         That said, here is my resume corrected.</p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h4>JOB POSITION</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>PHOENIX MODULAR/2021</li>
     At Phoenix Modular I worked in the door department prepping doors for a coworker to coat them in paint.
     I regularly installed hinges, handles, door closers, and even panic bars. This job required attention
     to detail, as some doors would be opening outward and some inward. Some would be required to open from
     the left and others to the right.
     It would take considerable comunication and people skills to work in-rhythm with teammates, both to
     accomplish the project on time and to modify some of the mis-planning consequences.
        <li>CHAS ROBERTS/2021</li>
     As an HVAC New Construction Rough-In it was my job to work with installers to 'hang AC flex' in the
     trusses of houses still under construction. I regularly found myself in a position to take initiative
     as well as inquire about city code and industry standards. Ironically to myself....this was hot work.
        <li>HOLSUM BAKERY/2020</li>
     While working with the Sanitation department at the HOLSUM BAKERY I was fortunate enough to discover
     that while repetitive in some ways Sanitation is refreshing by the week(and even by the day at times).
     This work honed my focus and determination to adhere to a working ethic that remains with me today.
     With this determination, along with a mindset to take responsibility upon myself, I was acknowleged
     and honored by supervisors throughout several departments and areas(being invited to join the safety
     committee!).
    </ul>
 
 <h2>SKILLS</h2>
 Some skills that I have acquired over time is the ability to focus, analyze, reason, and stay calm under
 some pressure. But, other skills that complement and even contrast these are the ability to cast a wider
 perspective on issues, and to considerably engage a discontent towards uncomforming issues. I find it to
 bolster my immediate resolve in matters of urgency.
 
 <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
 
 <ul>
  <li>GED</li>
  <li>Computer Maintenance and Repair/RIO SALADO Community College</li>
  <li>HVAC/RSI</li>
 </ul>
