    <p>If it's quite a good time to, I would now like to talk a little about me and what I like
        about the promise of becoming an excellent system's technician. I enjoy martial training
        such as muay thai and thai chi. I contrastly really feel particularly comfortable with
        being without too many constraints, and kind of freestyle it at times.
        Another creative side of me is socializing and communicating with, both, people and systems.
        Sometimes I fantasize about being 'the Network Whisperer'.
        I greatly appreciate this opportunity in my life, as well as the christian world-view
        that is consistently being practiced by the GCU counselors (especially Marsha Burton, my most wonderful
        and awesome supporter and motivator).
        This particular p-tag was written at a time when the rest of my coded resume had not been compeleted
        and actually did not even have the image source properly engaged.
    </p>
    <lb>I'm not too sure that I know what this tag even was honestly, but I do know that the tag sign 
        popped up at a time when I was 'stuck' at today's code that I wanted to add.
